She goes over and above to make sure everything is in place for the closings she is involved in.  She is a pure joy to work with.  There should be no hesitation when it comes to involving this one of a kind gal for help with your real estate transaction!",

Iâ€™m not sure how they get it all done but they definitely sweat the details and I always get great comments from our clients about Linda and her customer focused service. We consider Linda and her team an integral part of our success and I would recommend her services to everyone.",

        "testimonial": "Linda was a great addition to our real estate team so that we could leverage our time better to get more business. There are so many details that need taken care of post-acceptance prior to closing, that we wanted to be sure nothing fell through the cracks. Linda and her team are great with the process and details. Linda has actually been in real estate longer than myself, so often, she knows what to do, even if I don't. There are several instances where Linda went above and beyond what I believe a transaction coordinator is responsible for and that is why she is worth every penny.",
